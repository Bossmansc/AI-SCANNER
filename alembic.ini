# The following sections define the environment configuration for the
# Alembic migration environment. The `[alembic]` section is for general
# configuration, while the `[post_write_hooks]` section is for hooks that
# run after migration scripts are written.

# Post-write hooks configuration
[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines hooks that are run after a migration script is written.
# Hooks are defined as a list of plugin names, each with its own configuration.
# Example:
# hooks = black, flake8
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79
# flake8.type = console_scripts
# flake8.entrypoint = flake8
# flake8.options = --max-line-length=79

# The `hooks` key specifies the list of hooks to run.
# hooks =

# Each hook is configured with a `type`, `entrypoint`, and `options`.
# The `type` is usually "console_scripts".
# The `entrypoint` is the name of the console script to run.
# The `options` are command-line arguments passed to the script.

# Example hook configuration for black:
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79

# Example hook configuration for flake8:
# flake8.type = console_scripts
# flake8.entrypoint = flake8
# flake8.options = --max-line-length=79

# Note: Hooks are run in the order they are listed in the `hooks` key.

# The following is a sample configuration for using environment variables
# to set the database URL. This is useful for production deployments.
# Uncomment and adjust as needed.

# [alembic]
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}

# To use environment variables, you can use the `${VAR_NAME}` syntax.
# Ensure the variables are set in your environment.

# For production, you might want to set a more restrictive logging level.
# [logger_root]
# level = ERROR
# handlers = console
# qualname =

# [logger_sqlalchemy]
# level = ERROR
# handlers =
# qualname = sqlalchemy.engine

# [logger_alembic]
# level = WARN
# handlers =
# qualname = alembic

# You can also configure file-based logging by adding a file handler.
# [handlers]
# keys = console,file

# [handler_file]
# class = FileHandler
# args = ('alembic.log', 'a')
# level = NOTSET
# formatter = generic

# Then, add the file handler to the root logger or other loggers as needed.
# [logger_root]
# level = WARN
# handlers = console,file
# qualname =

# The formatter can be customized to include more details.
# [formatter_generic]
# format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)-5.5s [%(name)s] %(message)s
# datefmt = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

# Additional configuration for transactional DDL (if supported by your database).
# Some databases like PostgreSQL support transactional DDL, where schema changes
# can be rolled back within a transaction. Others like MySQL do not.
# Alembic's default is to run each migration in a transaction if the database supports it.
# You can override this with `transaction_per_migration` and `single_transaction`.

# For databases that do not support transactional DDL (e.g., MySQL with MyISAM),
# set `transaction_per_migration` to False.
# transaction_per_migration = False

# To run all migrations in a single transaction (if supported), set `single_transaction` to True.
# single_transaction = True

# Note: `single_transaction` is only relevant if `transaction_per_migration` is True.

# The `compare_type` and `compare_server_default` settings are important for autogenerate.
# They control how Alembic detects differences between the database and your models.
# If you have complex types or server defaults, you might need to adjust these.

# For example, if you use custom SQLAlchemy types, you might set `compare_type` to False
# and handle type changes manually.
# compare_type = False

# Similarly, if your server defaults are complex or not easily comparable, disable them.
# compare_server_default = False

# The `render_as_batch` setting is useful for SQLite, which has limited ALTER TABLE support.
# When set to True, Alembic will generate batch operations that are compatible with SQLite's
# batch mode. This is also useful for other databases when you want to use offline mode.
# render_as_batch = True

# Offline mode allows generating migration scripts without a database connection.
# This is useful for generating migrations in a CI/CD pipeline or when the database is not available.
# To use offline mode, set `sqlalchemy.url` to a dummy value and use the `--sql` flag.
# The generated SQL can then be applied manually or with a tool.

# Example for offline mode:
# sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///dummy.db
# Then run: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description" --sql

# The generated SQL will be written to stdout or a file, depending on your command.

# Remember to replace the dummy URL with the real one when running migrations online.

# This configuration file is designed to be comprehensive and cover many use cases.
# Adjust the settings according to your project's needs.

# https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/
